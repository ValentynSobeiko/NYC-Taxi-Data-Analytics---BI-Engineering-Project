##Data Engineering Pipeline: Yellow Taxi Trips NYC 2024 â€” Microsoft Fabric Project

This project is a comprehensive solution for creating an end-to-end pipeline for data processing, transformation and visualization using Microsoft Fabric, including Lakehouse, Data Factory, Dataflows Gen2, SQL Stored Procedures and Power BI.

Thanks to [Mr.Malvik Vaghadia](udemy.com/course/microsoft-fabric-the-ultimate-guide) for the project inspiration.

The project demonstrates the construction of a dynamic process for loading and preparing data with automatic parameterization and updating, including working with metadata and building a final report in Power BI.
