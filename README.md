This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end Azure data engineering solution, beginning with data ingestion from a local SQL database and culminating in automated Power BI reporting. The pipeline includes data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, fully orchestrated within Azure, showcasing a streamlined approach to data automation and visualization.
